The solution involves carefully reviewing the mathematical expression within the `calc()` function. Ensure correct operator usage (+, -, *, /), unit consistency, and proper parenthesis matching. Example: Replacing `width: calc(100% - 10px)` with `width: calc(100% - 10px);` (adding a missing semicolon) or `width: calc(100% - 10px)` with `width: calc(100% - 10px)` (fixing missing operator). Always test your calculations thoroughly.
