This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked error in CSS: misuse of the `calc()` function.  Incorrect calculation expressions within `calc()` can lead to unexpected rendering results or styles that simply don't apply. The `bug.css` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.  The issue is highlighted in the comments within the CSS files themselves.
