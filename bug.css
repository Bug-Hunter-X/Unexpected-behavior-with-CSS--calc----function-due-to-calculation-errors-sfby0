The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if you have an error in your calculation expression, it might cause unexpected behavior or rendering issues. For instance, missing operators, incorrect unit usage, or parentheses mismatches can lead to unexpected results or even prevent the CSS from applying correctly.  Example: `width: calc(100% - 10px);` is fine, but `width: calc(100% - 10px)` (missing `+`) or `width: calc(100% - px)` (missing unit on 10) will likely fail.
